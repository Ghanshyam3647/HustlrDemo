# Product Card UI
This project uses a card-based layout for product display, using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and utility classes for consistent spacing and alignment. I structured the components to remain visually balanced across different screen sizes, with responsive breakpoints (col-md, col-sm, etc.) to ensure an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
